simple-chess-program
A simple chess program using python (without AI and GUI).

I have created a chess program (which probably has some bugs that I have not yet discovered). However, it doesn't seem to work well with cmd, since it contains some unicode characters. It would be better to run it on an IDE. Run main.py to start the program. Please feel free to make any comments or suggestions to make it better.
