simple-chess-program
A simple chess program using python (without AI and GUI).

I have created a chess program (which probably has some bugs that I have not yet discovered). However, it doesn't seem to work well with cmd, since it contains some unicode characters. It would be better to run it on an IDE. Run main.py to start the program. Please feel free to make any comments or suggestions to make it better.

In the near future, I want to implement an AI model, probably using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. I also want to learn some GUI programming so that I can upgrade this program to a visible or even interactive one.
